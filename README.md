# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is a basic website abot me and my life's portfolio. It is three seperate pages. One page (index.html) with my basic background information, the second page (portfolio.html) has links to my portfolio, and the third (contact.html) has a form for the viewer to fill out with their contact information.

# Using bootstrap #

The primary tool used for this site was twitter's bootstrap. At the bottom of each html is a link to bootsrap code. This allows the website to do complex procedures without me writing all the code myself. For example, the navigation bar is the same on each page, and when it collapses it creates a hamburger drop down menu, this was accomplished by pasting code straight from boostraps website, it was that simple. Bootstrap was also used to make the cards on each page. For the index html or the about me page, a simple card with one picture and one paragraph was used. For the contact html,a card with a form inside it was used. For the portfolio page a card-index code was used to make multiple rows of pictures. Every button on each page was also made using boostrap code. The only css coding I added my self was for the pictures, making sure they were all the same size and some design elements for the footer.
